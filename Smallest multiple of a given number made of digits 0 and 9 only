/*
We are given an integer N. 
We need to write a program to find the least positive integer X made up of only digits 9’s and 0’s, such that, X is a multiple of N.

Input : N = 5
Output : X = 90
Exaplanation: 90 is the smallest number made up 
of 9's and 0's which is divisible by 5.

Input : N = 7
Output : X = 9009
Exaplanation: 9009 is smallest number made up 
of 9's and 0's which is divisible by 7.
